This directory contains the kernel images specific to the Android emulator.
They are built with the 'rebuild.sh' script contained here, usage is:

    ./rebuild.sh  /path/to/kernel/sources/

The kernel sources must correspond to one of the android-goldfish-2.6.XX
branches available from android.git.kernel.org/kernel/qemu.git. The script
will complain if it cannot find the files corresponding to the virtual hardware
architecture known as "goldfish".

See hw/goldfish_XXXX under the emulator sources for the corresponding virtual
hardware emulation code.
